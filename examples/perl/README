CALLING FPGALINK FROM PERL

This uses SWIG to generate a Perl binding. The generated API is more or less
identical to the hand-coded Python binding.


BUILDING ON LINUX

First you need SWIG: sudo apt-get install swig2.0

Second, check the Makefile to ensure it has the correct location of your Perl
installation.

Finally, type "make" to build the binding.

You can run the example code like this:

PERL5LIB=lin.x64/rel LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lin.x64/rel ./various.pl


BUILDING ON WINDOWS

First you need ActivePerl 5.16 (assuming Windows x64 here):

http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/releases/5.16.3.1603/ActivePerl-5.16.3.1603-MSWin32-x64-296746.msi

More recent versions are no longer built with MSVC. You may be able to get the
binding to work with more recent versions, but this build will definitely not
"just work" with anything other than 5.16.

Second, install SWIG:

cd /
wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swigwin-2.0.12.zip
unzip.exe swigwin-2.0.12.zip

Finally, type "make" in this directory to build the binding.

You can run the example code like this:

PERL5LIB=win.x64/rel PATH=win.x64/rel:$PATH ./various.pl
